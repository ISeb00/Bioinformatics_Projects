Projects for BIOL 668 Bioinformatics module

1. Sebor_QIIME2_code.txt
>Annotation of QIIME2 code used in the Moving Pictures tutorial. Includes generation of .qza and .qzv files, alpha and beta diversity plots, and taxonomic analyses.
2. Sebor_Limma Glimma_EdgeR.rmd
>Differential expression analyses preceded by data pre-processing, which includes transformations, normalization, and unsupervised clustering. Pre-processed data subjected to removal of heteroscedascity and then fit to linear models. Differentially expressed genes represented graphically. Uses mouse_c2_v5p2.rdata. Other data files and libraries imported within notebook.
3. Sebor_DESEQ2.rmd
>Uses rna_counts_data.csv and rna_map_update copy.csv to run differential expression analyses. Data is pre-filtered to normalize counts and then analyzed with the DESeq command. PCA and volcano plots are generated for visualization.
4. Sebor_Seurat.rmd
>Uses pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz to perform feature selection, scaling and normalization, linear and non-linear dimensional reduction, cell clustering, identification of differentially expressed features, and cell type annotation.
